                        I perceive myself as a mature, responsible, and organized person. I am ambitious and focused.
                        <br>
                        When I set a goal, I work hard to achieve it. I am a perfectionist and take great pride in always doing my best.
                        Furthermore, I am a great team player and understand the importance of collaboration.
                        <br><br>
                        I am also very sociable and excel in group work. However, I am also capable of working independently on my own tasks.
                        <br><br>
                        I am definitely not an expert in software development and programming, but I have a strong desire to learn.
