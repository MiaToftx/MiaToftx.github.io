                        I perceive myself as a mature, responsible, and organized person. I am ambitious and focused.

                        When I set a goal, I work hard to achieve it. I am a perfectionist and take great pride in always doing my best.
                        Furthermore, I am a great team player and understand the importance of collaboration.

                        I am also very sociable and excel in group work. However, I am also capable of working independently on my own tasks.

                        I am definitely not an expert in software development and programming, but I have a strong desire to learn.

                            I am currently working as a student assistant in the IT department at Hummel in Aarhus.
                            I am part of the Datahub and Integrations team, where I independently handle tasks of various kinds.
                            I have learned a lot of valuable skills in my role as a student assistant,
                            particularly gaining insights into the work environment and collaboration within a large company.

                            In the position as a customer consultant, I was responsible for telephone sales as well as handling customer service
                            and billing-related questions. I had responsibility for meeting my own targets.
                            I demonstrated the ability to take ownership of my tasks while being adaptable in a fast-paced and rapidly changing work environment.
